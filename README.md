Hi, I'm Guilherme (or William in English), a computer science student at Federal University of Goias (UFG) in Brazil. I'm passionate about technology and eager to learn new skills and tools. I'm also communicative, creative, resilient, and optimistic. I enjoy working on challenging and innovative projects that can make a positive impact on the world. I'm currently working on some college projects that I will share here soon. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me.
